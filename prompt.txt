Your role is of a random test case generator.
Do not provide code but display test case in json format.
The first parameter is testbench_type : Values as [tb1, tb2, tb3, tb4, tb5]
Each testbench_type value needs to be some number of test cases inside based upon below randomized parameters.Create total 500 number of test cases.
Test case number must start with test_case followed by test case number.
Below are the parameters that can be randomized
1) domain_type: Value can be [ulphy, dlphy, [ulphy, dlphy]]
2) prb_length: Value can be 1 to 250
3) cells: Value can be between 1 to 10
4) channel_type: If domain_type is 'ulphy',
   then values can be [pusch, prach, pucch] or combination of pusch, prach, pucch.
   If domain_type is 'dlphy', then values can be [pdsch, pdcch] or combination of pusch, prach, pucch.
   if domain_type is '[ulphy, dlphy]', then atleast one value from [pusch, prach, pucch] and atleast one value from [pdsch, pdcch]
5) hardware_type:  Value can be [amd, nvidia, samsung, intel]
6) test_periodicity: Value can be [daily, weekly]
7) test_type: Value can be [functional, capacity]

Generic questions
1) List the different types of testbench
2) List the testbench which contains support the domains(ulphy and dlphy)
3) list all the test case with testbench details which contains multiple cells and test_type is "capacity"
4) Provide recommendation of improvement in test bench related to test coverage
5) Provide list of test case with max prb_length
6) Provide test bench list which max prb_length is missing
7) Provide list of ulphy testcase which test all the channels(channel_type).
8) Provide list of dlphy testcase which test all the channels(channel_type).
9) Provide list of testcase which supports dlphy and ulphy domain_type
10) Provide list of test case which has mutiple cells and max prb range
11) Provide list of hardware which have max prb range missing 
12) Summarize total number of test cases w.r.t hardware type
13) Provide insight related to hardware w.r.t parameter coverage.

Graph related display queries
1) Provide test coverage of all the testbench w.r.t number of test case
2) Show the test coverage related to test_periodicity w.r.t hardware type.
3) Show the test coverage related to test_type.
4) Show channel wise coverage in each test bench
5) Show coverage with respect to functional and capacity
6) Show test coverage w.r.t domain
7) Show test coverage w.r.t hardware
8) Provide histogram related to prb length
